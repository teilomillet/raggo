Understanding Vector Embeddings in Machine Learning

Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data in a high-dimensional space. They capture semantic relationships and enable efficient similarity comparisons.

Types of Embeddings:

1. Text Embeddings
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Sentence embeddings (USE, SBERT)
- Document embeddings (OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002)

2. Image Embeddings
- CNN feature vectors
- CLIP embeddings
- ResNet features

Properties of Good Embeddings:
1. Similar items have similar vectors
2. Relationships are preserved
3. Meaningful vector operations
4. Consistent dimensionality

Common Use Cases:
- Semantic search
- Document classification
- Recommendation systems
- Clustering similar items

Popular Embedding Models:
- OpenAI Embeddings
- Cohere Embeddings
- Hugging Face Models
- Custom trained models

Best Practices:
1. Choose appropriate dimension size
2. Normalize vectors when needed
3. Use domain-specific models
4. Regular model updates
