Go (also known as Golang) is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. Here are some key features:

1. Simplicity and Readability
Go emphasizes simplicity in its design. The language has a clean syntax and a small set of keywords, making it easy to learn and read.

2. Built-in Concurrency Support
Go provides goroutines for concurrent execution and channels for communication between goroutines. A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime.

Example of concurrent programming in Go:
```go
go func() {
    // This runs concurrently
    fmt.Println("Hello from goroutine!")
}()
```

3. Package System
Go has a powerful package system for code organization. The standard library provides many essential packages for common programming tasks.

4. Error Handling
Go uses explicit error handling instead of exceptions. Functions often return an error value that must be checked:
```go
result, err := someFunction()
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
```

5. Fast Compilation
Go compiles very quickly compared to other compiled languages, making the development cycle more efficient.
