Understanding RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Systems

RAG systems combine information retrieval with language model generation to produce more accurate and contextual responses. Here's how they work:

1. Document Processing
- Documents are split into chunks
- Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding
- Embeddings are stored in a vector database

2. Retrieval Process
When a query is received:
- Convert query to vector embedding
- Search vector database for similar content
- Retrieve most relevant chunks

3. Generation
- Retrieved context is combined with the original query
- Large Language Model (LLM) generates response using this context
- Results are more factual and grounded in source documents

4. Benefits
- Reduced hallucination in LLM responses
- Up-to-date information from your document base
- Source attribution for generated content
- Lower costs through efficient prompting

5. Common Challenges
- Choosing optimal chunk sizes
- Balancing retrieval speed vs accuracy
- Managing context window limitations
- Handling document updates efficiently

Best Practices:
- Regular document updates
- Careful chunk size selection
- Quality embeddings generation
- Proper prompt engineering
