Vector Databases: A Comprehensive Overview

Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are crucial for modern machine learning applications, especially in similarity search and recommendation systems.

Key Concepts:

1. Vector Embeddings
Vectors represent data points in a high-dimensional space. Text, images, or any other data can be converted into vector embeddings using machine learning models.

2. Similarity Search
Vector databases excel at finding similar items using distance metrics like:
- Euclidean distance (L2)
- Cosine similarity
- Inner product (IP)

3. Indexing Methods
Common indexing techniques include:
- HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
- IVF (Inverted File Index)
- PQ (Product Quantization)

These methods enable fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in high-dimensional spaces.

4. Popular Vector Database Systems
- Milvus: Open-source vector database with high performance
